# Base Converter
A Python program that converts number from base 10 (decimal) to base R (maximum of hexadecimal) and vice versa, including decimal points.

**Note:**
Made as a school project during my first year Python class, works as intended but probably needs clean-up and optimization. Uploaded for archival purposes.
